<!-- Thank you for contributing to 3D Slicer! Please describe which extension is updated and optionally tell us in a sentence what has been changed. To make extension updates easier in the future (so that you don't have to submit a new pull request after each change in your extension), you may consider replacing specific git hash in your s4ext file by a branch name (for example: `master` or `release` for nightly version; `(majorVersion).(minorVersion)` such as `4.10` for stable Slicer version). -->
